# Blood Types Data Analysis

This project was created for the Data Science Fundamentals class, ministered by prof. Tiago C. Reis at IPLuso.
Its main goal is to extract information about blood types around the world from public data gathered from a web source.
The code was created to read a txt file, containing data from a table, transform it and create a dictionary type object. 
This object was manipulated in order to gain insights according to some objectives defined beforehand (e.g. Which country has the highest incidence of each blood type; which blood type is the rarest; statistics for each blood type)

As a result, the code provides a txt report with all the information and also 2 images that represent the boxplots and hystograms for each blood type distribution according to the data analysed.
The generated images should be as shown below:
